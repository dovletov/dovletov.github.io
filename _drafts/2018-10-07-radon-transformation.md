This post is the mosts clear explanation of Radon-Transformations, which is used in computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) image generation and reconstruction.

### Sinogram generation

The Radon transform data is often called a sinogram.

Example of sinogram generation.


### Reconstruction from sinogram

Homogeneous object, monochromatic radiation 

$$ I_d = I_0 \cdot \exp^{-\mu d} $$

$$ \ln{\frac{I_d}{I_0}} = -\mu d $$

$$ \ln{\frac{I_0}{I_d}} = \mu d $$

$$ \mu = \frac{1}{d}\ln{\frac{I_0}{I_d}} $$

Non-homogeneous object, mono-chromatic

$$ I_d = I_0 \cdot \exp^{-\mu_1 d_1-\mu_2 d_2-\mu_3 d_3 \dots} = I_0 \cdot \exp^{-\sum_i \mu_i d_i} = ( I_0 \cdot \int_0^d \mu ds ) $$

$$ \ln{\frac{I_0}{I_d}} = \sum_i \mu_i d_i $$

$$ \mu_i = ? $$
