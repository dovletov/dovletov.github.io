I spent quite a bit of time trying to find the best time tracking software that would cover all my needs.
One of the most important features for me was that it should work under Lunux and have a nice intuitive visual interface.
Besides, I expected to find a free software, because all the functions I need are related to the controling of my personal time management and not to the management of a large project or a team of collaborators.
After testing several candidates I found the best software for me: [TimeCamp](https://www.timecamp.com/).

Originally, I started writing this post more than two years ago, but due to time management issues, I kept putting off this task.
When I was choosing time tracking software, there wasn't much choice. 
Apparently, some of the candidates didn't survive, because I couldn't even find information about them when I was finishing this post.
That's why I'd rather focus on TimeCamp in this post and not compare it to some unexisting programs.


Since it is a web-based software, the problem of compatibility was solved from the very beginning.
One of the main features of TimeCamp is two different types of time tracking.
One is a text-based interface for a single day, the other is a nice graphical interface for a whole week (aka TimeSheet).
I personally prefer the second one, as it gives you a clear visual indication of which tasks/projects are taking up the most time.
For me as a PhD student who has to do teaching (40% of the time) in addition to my own research (60% of the time), this is a crucial point as I do not want to exceed the allocated time budget.

TimeCamp also offers the possibility to manage your task projects hierarchically and assign a color to each tasks.
Combined with the TimeSheet feature I mentioned earlier, this is a great combination, which allows me to see at a glance how productive I am om this particular week.

TimeCamp also offers a desktop and a mobile application, as well as many additional features such as automatic time tracking, etc.
After testing the desktop application on Linux, I decided to stick with the web interface and add task entries manually.
Personally, I find it more convenient, as I'm not interested in super-precise timekeeping with an error range in minutes.

This software also offers many other free features (e.g. reports, unlimited users and tasks), and probably even more if you use paid plans.
So, all in all, it's a great tool that I can recommend to all those who desperately want to save time and achieve all their goals in this life.
